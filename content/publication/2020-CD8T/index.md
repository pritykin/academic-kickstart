abstract: "CD8 T cells play an essential role in defense against viral and bacterial infections and in tumor immunity. Deciphering T cell loss of functionality is complicated by the conspicuous heterogeneity of CD8 T cell states described across different experimental and clinical settings. By carrying out a unified analysis of over 300 ATAC-seq and RNA-seq experiments from twelve independent studies of CD8 T cell dysfunction in cancer and infection we defined a shared differentiation trajectory towards terminal dysfunction and its underlying transcriptional drivers and revealed a universal early bifurcation of functional and dysfunctional T cell activation states across models. Experimental dissection of acute and chronic viral infection using scATAC-seq and allele-specific scRNA-seq identified state-specific transcription factors and captured the early emergence of highly similar TCF1+ progenitor-like populations at an early branch point, at which epigenetic features of functional and dysfunctional T cells diverge. Our atlas of CD8 T cell states will facilitate mechanistic studies of T cell immunity and translational efforts."

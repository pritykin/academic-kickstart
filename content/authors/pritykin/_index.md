I am an Assistant Professor in [the Lewis-Sigler Institute for Integrative Genomics](https://lsi.princeton.edu/) and [the Computer Science Department](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/) at [Princeton University](https://www.princeton.edu/) (starting January 2021).

My main interest and expertise are in using applied statistics, machine learning, and efficient algorithms to address fundamental problems in biology and medicine by integrative analysis of multi-dimensional data.

Previously I was a postdoctoral researcher in [the Leslie lab](https://www.mskcc.org/research/ski/labs/christina-leslie) in [Computational and Systems Biology Program](https://www.mskcc.org/research/ski/programs/computational-biology) at [Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center](https://www.mskcc.org/research/ski). I received PhD in [computer science](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/) from [Princeton University](https://www.princeton.edu/) advised by [Mona Singh](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~mona/) and MSc and PhD in [mathematics](https://www.msu.ru/en/info/struct/depts/mechmath.html) from [Lomonosov Moscow State University](https://www.msu.ru/en/) advised by [Alexei Semenov](https://dblp.org/pid/43/3466.html) and [Andrej Muchnik](https://dblp.org/pid/m/AndrejMuchnik.html). I finished [Moscow School 57](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_State_School_57).


#### Positions

Positions for computational biologists are available at multiple levels in my lab, details and the lab website coming soon. Prospective PhD students interested in working with me are encouraged to apply to [QCB](https://lsi.princeton.edu/qcbgraduate) and [CS](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/grad) graduate programs at Princeton. Current Princeton students interested in working with me are encouraged to [contact me](#contact) directly.


#### Awards

* AACR-Bristol-Myers Squibb Immuno-oncology Research Fellowship (2019)
* Memorial Sloan Kettering-Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy-Cycle for Survival Fund (2018)
